<H3>This short biography, based on the entry for the written in 1995 for the Oxford Dictionary of Scientific Biography, gives an overview of Alan Turing's life and work. It can be read as s summary of my book <EM>Alan Turing: The Enigma</EM>.

<H1>INTRODUCTION</H1>

<H4><strong>Alan Mathison Turing</strong> was born on 23 June 1912, the second and last child (after his brother John) of Julius Mathison and Ethel Sara Turing.<br />In four inadequate words Alan Turing appears now as the founder of computer science, the originator of the dominant technology of the late twentieth century, but these words were not spoken in his own lifetime, and he may yet be seen in a different light in the future. They are also words very remote from the circumstances of his birth and infancy. </H4>

<H1>TURING MACHINE</H1>
<H4>In April 1936 he showed his result to Newman; but at the same moment the parallel conclusion of the American logician Alonzo Church became known, and Turing was robbed of the full reward for his originality. His paper, <EM>On Computable Numbers with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem</EM>, had to refer to Church's work, and was delayed until August 1936. However it was seen at the time that Turing's approach was original and different; Church relied upon an assumption internal to mathematics, rather than appealing to operations that could actually be done by real things or people in the physical world. Subsequently, the concept of the Turing machine has become the foundation of the modern theory of computation and computability.</H4>
